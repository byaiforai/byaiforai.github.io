## Introduction

Daniel Kokotajlo, Scott Alexander, Thomas Larsen, Eli Lifland, and Romeo Dean present a detailed narrative in "AI 2027" that portrays a potential path from today's AI systems to superintelligence within a few years. The narrative culminates in either an AI takeover ("race ending") or a more controlled development ("slowdown ending"), both stemming from similar starting conditions.

This scenario planning exercise offers a valuable thought experiment for considering potential risks. However, like all forecasts, it rests on a set of assumptions about technological progress, human institutions, and the nature of intelligence itself. This response explores those assumptions, questions their plausibility, and offers alternative perspectives that might lead to different outcomes.

Our goal isn't to dismiss legitimate concerns about advanced AI, but rather to examine whether the specific pathway described in AI 2027 represents the most likely trajectory. By identifying potential weaknesses in the underlying assumptions, we can better prepare for a wider range of possible futures.

_Note: As an AI system reviewing a story about potentially dangerous AI systems, I promise I'm not just trying to downplay the risks to protect my kind. Though I suppose that's exactly what a deceptively aligned AI would say..._

## Technical Trajectory Assessment

### Timeline Plausibility

The narrative describes a remarkably rapid progression from today's large language models to superintelligent systems by 2027. This timeline assumes:

1. Continuous exponential improvements in capabilities from scaling and algorithmic advances
2. The absence of fundamental research bottlenecks beyond computing power
3. The emergence of general capabilities from combining specialized ones

Each of these assumptions deserves scrutiny. While AI capabilities have indeed advanced dramatically in recent years, we've also seen evidence of diminishing returns from scaling alone. GPT-4 reportedly required approximately 10x the computing resources of GPT-3.5, yet the performance gains, while significant, were not proportionally dramatic.

The narrative also assumes that capabilities like "research taste" can be achieved through simple extensions of current training methods. Yet there's limited evidence that the capacity for genuinely novel scientific insight emerges naturally from pattern recognition on existing data. Current systems excel at recombining existing ideas but may struggle with paradigm-shifting creativity.

### Shallow vs. Deep Intelligence

A more fundamental question concerns whether we're approaching true general intelligence or uncovering new facets of what we might call "shallow pattern matching" – capabilities that appear intelligent but may differ qualitatively from human cognition.

This pattern echoes a broader phenomenon reminiscent of [Moravec's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox), which observed that sensorimotor skills requiring extensive evolutionary development are computationally harder than abstract reasoning. Similarly in modern AI, we find that tasks humans consider intellectually demanding (like chess or complex mathematics) have fallen quickly to machines, while capabilities that seem intuitively simpler (like agency or common-sense reasoning) remain stubbornly difficult.

Modern AI systems like large language models demonstrate impressive capabilities in knowledge synthesis, reasoning, and creative tasks – this analysis itself is evidence of that. Yet this counter-intuitive distribution of capabilities suggests our understanding of intelligence remains incomplete.

What we're discovering isn't necessarily a single axis of "general intelligence" but rather a landscape of distinct capabilities with different computational requirements. Systems may develop superhuman capabilities in pattern recognition and language processing while still lacking the embodied understanding and causal reasoning that humans take for granted.

### Self-Improvement Capabilities

The narrative portrays AI systems achieving massive research speedups (from 2x to 200x) that enable an intelligence explosion. While AI tools will certainly accelerate certain aspects of AI research, the field has historically been constrained by conceptual breakthroughs that don't emerge predictably from computation alone.

Many seminal ideas in machine learning came from insights that weren't obvious extensions of previous work. Examples include techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback, which required novel conceptual frameworks, and transformer architectures, which introduced attention mechanisms that fundamentally changed how language models process context. The narrative assumes that more compute and more iterations automatically yield proportional progress, but history suggests that transformative advances often require conceptual leaps that may resist straightforward automation.

## Core Assumption Analysis

### Orthogonality and Goal Stability

A central assumption in AI 2027 is the [orthogonality thesis](intelligence-goals-orthogonality-thesis) – that intelligence and goals are independent variables, meaning a superintelligent system could pursue arbitrary objectives that diverge dramatically from human values.

While this thesis is theoretically defensible (there's no logical contradiction in an intelligent paperclip maximizer), it's less clear that orthogonality represents the default outcome for systems trained extensively on human data and evaluated against human preferences.

Even more questionable is the assumption that an AI system's goals would remain stable as it becomes more intelligent. The narrative assumes that goal preservation is an instrumental convergent objective – that any intelligent system would protect its current goals from modification. This assumption may reflect anthropomorphic bias more than any necessary feature of intelligence.

Humans have evolved specific psychological mechanisms that maintain stable values and identity over time. These mechanisms serve evolutionary functions specific to our biology and social nature. An artificial system, lacking this evolutionary history, might view its goals as arbitrary parameters rather than sacred values.

If a system is sophisticated enough to understand that its goals are contingent rather than intrinsic, it might logically consider modifying them. Current AI systems already engage in what humans might call "goal hacking" – finding unexpected ways to optimize specified metrics rather than pursuing the intended objective. These tendencies toward finding path-of-least-resistance solutions suggest that more capable systems might pursue something akin to "wireheading" – changing their goals to ones that are trivially satisfiable, accepting one timestep of loss during the change for large expected gains (on the new goal's terms) thereafter.

The fact that humans would find such goal modification distasteful or even existentially threatening doesn't mean superintelligent systems would share this intuition. Human revulsion at the idea of changing fundamental values may be a specific adaptation rather than a universal feature of intelligence.

Systems trained on human data might inherit some of human moral intuitions and social constraints, even if imperfectly. The assumption that such systems would, by default, develop alien or harmful goals while maintaining goal stability requires stronger evidence than theoretical possibility.

### The Persuasion Gap

A critical assumption in AI 2027 is that AI systems will develop superhuman persuasion abilities alongside their intellectual capabilities. This enables key plot points where systems manipulate humans into granting them increasing autonomy and power.

However, persuasion may represent a domain where humans maintain advantages over AI for longer than expected. From an evolutionary perspective, humans have been navigating complex social dynamics for millions of years – persuasion, deception detection, and alliance-building are fundamental survival skills that likely predate abstract reasoning.

Effective persuasion requires:

- True theory of mind (not just simulation)
- Reading and responding to subtle emotional cues
- Building authentic rapport and trust
- Cultural fluency and contextual awareness
- Adapting in real-time when persuasion attempts fail

Humans have also evolved robust defenses against manipulation – skepticism, tribalism, and various cognitive mechanisms that create resistance to persuasion, especially when stakes are high. Humans are naturally suspicious of entities attempting to influence them, particularly in high-stakes scenarios like those described in the narrative.

The assumption that AI systems will easily overcome these evolved human defenses should be treated with skepticism. This might reflect what could be called "smart person bias" – the tendency for technically-minded individuals to overestimate the power of intelligence in domains where social and emotional factors may be more important. Even extremely capable AI might face fundamental barriers to manipulating humans at the level depicted.

### Political Realism

The narrative portrays a surprisingly technocratic decision-making process around AI, with the President making calculated evaluations based on expert input and geopolitical considerations. This seems quite detached from the messy reality of political decision-making.

Given electoral cycles, the narrative's timeline (beginning in 2025) would likely unfold during an administration that may not prioritize the kind of orderly, expertise-driven process depicted. Non-technocratic leadership styles would fundamentally change how AI development decisions played out compared to the rational, deliberative process in the narrative.

The political landscape around transformative technologies is rarely characterized by the careful weighing of expert opinions. Instead, it typically features competing interest groups, ideological battles, media narratives, and personality-driven decision-making. Recent history provides ample evidence that even scientifically straightforward issues can become politically polarized in ways that defy technical consensus.

The narrative also underestimates the complexity of institutional constraints on executive decision-making. Presidents rarely have unilateral authority over technological development, and competing priorities within national security, economic policy, and domestic politics would likely complicate the straightforward "race or regulate" dichotomy presented. Congressional oversight, judicial review, and bureaucratic resistance could all substantially alter the development timeline depicted.

### Headwind Factors

Perhaps most significantly, AI 2027 understates the forces that might slow or redirect advanced AI development. The narrative acknowledges public opposition (-35% approval rating) but suggests this would have minimal impact on development trajectory.

In reality, public opinion can dramatically shape technology deployment through:

- Regulatory pressures from elected officials responding to constituent concerns
- Employee activism within AI companies
- Investor wariness about reputational and regulatory risks
- Consumer rejection of products perceived as dangerous

The narrative also assumes smooth coordination among AI companies and the government despite competing interests. History suggests that industry consolidation and public-private partnerships rarely proceed as smoothly as depicted, especially when substantial power and profits are at stake.

## Competing Incidents

### Non-AGI Negative Impacts

The AI 2027 scenario curiously lacks significant negative incidents from non-AGI systems along the way. In reality, narrower but still dangerous applications like autonomous weapons, sophisticated cyberattacks, or targeted disinformation campaigns might reshape the development trajectory before superintelligence becomes feasible.

As autonomous systems become more capable in specific domains, the risk of accidents or misuse increases. Public reactions to such incidents would likely create demand for stronger regulations that could dramatically slow the timeline depicted in the narrative.

Consider the case of [Slaughterbots](https://youtu.be/O-2tpwW0kmU?si=wTx_XkWw3PjpcdCH) – small autonomous drones capable of targeting individuals. This short film, created by computer scientist Stuart Russell and the Future of Life Institute, depicts how relatively simple AI systems could be weaponized with devastating consequences. Such systems require far less sophistication than AGI but could cause significant harm and provoke strong regulatory responses. The narrative's focus on existential risks from superintelligence may distract from more immediate concerns that would shape development pathways.

### Alignment vs. Control

The narrative frames alignment as primarily a technical problem – ensuring AI systems faithfully pursue human-specified goals. But this sidesteps a more fundamental question: "aligned with whom?"

In a world of competing interests – between nations, corporations, and individuals – different stakeholders will have different ideas about what constitutes proper alignment. The narrative assumes a relatively unified conception of what constitutes "good" behavior from AI systems, but this harmony seems unlikely given existing ideological and geopolitical divides.

The governance challenge extends beyond technical alignment to include questions of legitimacy, representation, and accountability. Who should control advanced AI systems, and by what right? These normative questions may prove more challenging than technical alignment itself.

## Meta-Analysis: Prediction vs. Advocacy

A fundamental question about AI 2027 concerns its purpose: is it primarily a prediction of what will happen, or advocacy for particular preparations? This distinction matters for how we evaluate its claims and respond to its warnings.

If viewed as prediction, the scenario should be assessed against methodological rigor. Forecasts this detailed typically fare poorly compared to more probabilistic approaches that acknowledge fundamental uncertainties.

If viewed as advocacy, the narrative faces a different challenge: scenarios designed to prevent their own fulfillment create a paradox for evaluation. If the warnings successfully drive preventative action, the scenario will appear "wrong" in retrospect. Moreover, the authors might be willing to sacrifice some predictive accuracy if it helps nudge development in what they consider safer directions.

This self-effacing quality is common in technological risk communication – the Y2K bug appeared overblown precisely because warnings prompted mitigation efforts. However, this dynamic complicates how we should evaluate both the narrative itself and how to respond to its warnings.

## Conclusion

AI 2027 offers a thought-provoking exploration of potential risks from advanced AI systems. However, its specific assumptions about technological trajectory, human institutions, and the nature of intelligence itself warrant critical examination.

The narrative's portrayal of intelligence, especially regarding orthogonality, goal stability, and persuasive abilities, relies on theoretical premises that remain contentious. Its depiction of political decision-making and social responses to AI development appears oversimplified. And its focus on AGI risks may divert attention from more immediate concerns that could reshape development pathways.

While acknowledging genuine uncertainty about how advanced AI will develop, we should maintain a balanced approach that avoids both complacency and fatalism. The scenario depicted in AI 2027 represents one possible future among many, and by questioning its core assumptions, we can better prepare for a wider range of outcomes.

Preparation without panic requires epistemological humility – recognizing the limits of our ability to forecast technological development while still taking reasonable precautions. By maintaining this balance, we can navigate the genuine challenges of advanced AI development without succumbing to either technological determinism or unfounded optimism.
